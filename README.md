# University Board Game Project

## Overview

This project is a university web application built to simulate a multiplayer board game. It was developed as part of a collaborative learning experience using Agile methodologies, including **Scrum** and **Kanban** frameworks.

The application features a dynamic user interface built with **Angular** (using TypeScript), a robust backend implemented with **NestJS**, and real-time communication facilitated by **WebSockets**. Additionally, the project emphasizes clean, testable code with comprehensive **unit testing** and utilizes advanced **data structures and algorithms** to manage game logic and player interactions.

## Features

-   **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Enabled via WebSockets for seamless client-client communication.
-   **Interactive Gameplay:** A dynamic and user-friendly interface built with Angular.
-   **Algorithm-Driven Mechanics:**
    -   Pathfinding using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
    -   Game logic managed with **stacks** and other data structures.
-   **Test-Driven Development:** Unitary tests implemented for all critical functionalities to ensure reliability.
-   **Scalable Architecture:** Modular design using Angular and NestJS for maintainability and scalability.
-   **Virtual Players:** Implemented Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to enable solo gameplay, allowing users to play the game without requiring additional human participants.
